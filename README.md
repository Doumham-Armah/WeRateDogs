# WeRateDogs
This is a summary of the insights that I was able to draw based on tweets I collected from WeRateDogs​ ​on twitter. This account tweets pictures of dogs and rates them on a scale
from 1-10. However, since some dogs are very adorable they might receive a rating of more than 10!
The data set I collected contains ​113 ​different dog breeds. The images were run through a neural network to classify their breeds.
